        <h2><big>What is Machine Learning ?</big></h2>
        <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data
            and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following pre-written rules, ML models
            identify patterns in data and improve their performance over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2><big>Types of Machine Learning</big></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Supervised Learning: Model learns from labeled data to predict outcomes (e.g., classification,
                regression).</li>
            <li>Unsupervised Learning: Model finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection).
            </li>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning: Model learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties (e.g.,
                game AI, robotics).</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="section">
        <h2><big>Difference Between AI, ML, and Deep Learning</big></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> AI is the broader concept of creating machines that can
                perform tasks that typically require human intelligence (e.g., reasoning, learning, problem-solving).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> ML is a subset of AI that focuses on training models to learn
                from data and improve performance without explicit programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning (DL):</strong> DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers
                (deep networks) to learn from large amounts of data, especially for tasks like image and speech
                recognition.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2><big>What is Data Preprocessing ?</big></h2>
        <p>Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data to make it suitable for machine
            learning models.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates.</li>
            <li>Data Transformation: Normalize or scale data, encode categorical features.</li>
            <li>Feature Selection: Choose important features.</li>
            <li>Data Splitting: Split data into training and test sets.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2><big>What is Overfitting and Underfitting?</big></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> Model learns too much from training data, including noise, leading to poor
                generalization.</li>
            <li><strong>Underfitting:</strong> Model is too simple, unable to capture key patterns, leading to poor
                performance on both training and test data.</li>
        </ul>
